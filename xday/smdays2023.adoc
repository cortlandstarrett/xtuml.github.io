== What is this?

*Shlaer-Mellor Day 2023* is a modeling conference and represents the 10th
edition of Shlaer-Mellor Day (also xtUML Day).  (See <<Previous Shlaer-Mellor Days>>.)
Shlaer-Mellor Day is the premier gathering of the year of Shlaer-Mellor modelers.
The Shlaer-Mellor xtUML Community meets to collaborate on Modeling, Method and Tooling.

The central topic of the conference is end-to-end modeling, execution,
translation and deployment of models-as-code in mission critical settings
employing rigorous methodology.  The unifying theme is practical, actual,
industrial application modeling within production installations.
Attendees will network with engineers, scientists and educators who
understand executable and translatable modeling as applied in active
systems.

In 2023 continued attention is paid to extending and clarifying the
__Shlaer-Mellor Method__ in light of undocumented developments over the
last several years.

Also in focus:

* Method advances
* Tooling Refinements  
* Incremental Adoption
* Model Compilation

The Shlaer-Mellor Community is keen to exchange expertise and learn from one
another.  Shlaer-Mellor Day provides a forum for developers to share best
practices and influence the direction of the technology.  The conference committee
hereby solicits compelling papers and presentations that exhibit method
advances, tooling improvements and application experience in Shlaer-Mellor
modeling and related Executable/Translatable modeling.

=== Conference Format and Venue

Shlaer-Mellor Day is an information dense and interactive conference
lasting 4 hours.  Presentations with Q&A and discussions will
fill the session.  Shlaer-Mellor Community members will give updates on
their applications and experiences.  An open moderated discussion time
ends the day.

Shlaer-Mellor Day 2023 will be hosted on https://zoom.us/[*Zoom*].  This
platform is familiar to most and supports interaction with people as well
as access to presentations.

Technical sessions are pre-recorded videos, ensuring high-density,
fast-paced information transfer while allowing the speakers to interact
with the audience as the video plays.

* model integrity  
* action language dialects  
* target software architectures and translation onto those architectures  
* process integration of modeling and modeling tools  
* tooling supporting the Shlaer-Mellor Method  
* current state of the art editing, verification, translation, debugging  
* recent experience with tooling and BridgePoint in particular  
* techniques for educating modelers from young children to experienced professionals

Presentations are expected to be 10-30 minutes in duration with additional
time for questions and discussion.

All submissions will be evaluated by the program committee.  
Selection is based upon significance, clarity and alignment with the call
