== What is this?

*Shlaer-Mellor Days 2022* is a modeling conference and represents the 9th
edition of Shlaer-Mellor Days (formerly known as xtUML Days).  (See <<Previous xtUML Days>>.)
Shlaer-Mellor Days is the most dense gathering of the year of Shlaer-Mellor modelers.
The Shlaer-Mellor xtUML Community meets to collaborate on Modeling, Method and Tooling.

The central topic of the conference is end-to-end modeling, execution,
translation and deployment of models-as-code in mission critical settings
employing rigorous methodology.  The unifying theme is practical, actual,
industrial application modeling within production installations.
Attendees will network with engineers, scientists and educators who
understand executable and translatable modeling as applied in active
systems.

In 2022, a special focus will be continued to extend and
clarify the __Shlaer-Mellor Method__ in light of undocumented developments
over the last several years.

Also in focus:

* Method advances (specifically convergence and rationalization of PT and K-C dialects)  
* Tooling Refinements  
* Incremental Adoption
* Model Compilation

The Shlaer-Mellor Community is keen to exchange expertise and learn from one
another.  Shlaer-Mellor Days provides a forum for developers to share best
practices and influence the direction of the technology.  The conference committee
hereby solicits compelling papers and presentations that exhibit method
advances, tooling improvements and application experience in Shlaer-Mellor
modeling and related Executable/Translatable modeling.
// This year attendees represent One Fact, UK Crown, BAE Systems, Maile Technical,
// Aurora Consulting, Software Improvements,
// ICS, FrogOOA
// and Jönköping University.

=== Presenters

Key Shlaer-Mellor community members planning to participate include Mike Lee,
Paul Francis, Colin Carter, Ian Wilkie, Leon Starr, Marc Balcer, Levi Starrett
and others.

and presentations.  Selection is based upon perceived value to the Shlaer-Mellor
Community.

Topics of interest to Shlaer-Mellor Days include but are not limited to the following:  

* real-world application modeling examples of installed systems  
* techniques of editing, verifying, translating, debugging and deploying models  
* methodology (Shlaer-Mellor) advances, extensions and refinements  
* static analysis of models and generated code  
* model-based model compilers  
* model integrity  
* action language dialects  
* target software architectures and translation onto those architectures  
* process integration of modeling and modeling tools  
* tooling supporting the Shlaer-Mellor Method  
* current state of the art editing, verification, translation, debugging  
* recent experience with tooling and BridgePoint in particular  
* techniques for educating modelers from young children to experienced professionals  
* tooling migration experience reports  

Presentations are expected to be 10-30 minutes in duration with additional
time for questions and discussion.

All submissions will be evaluated by the program committee.  
Selection is based upon significance, clarity and alignment with the call
and value to the attendees of Shlaer-Mellor Days 2022.  Submissions
that promote discussion, advance the Method and generate interaction among
