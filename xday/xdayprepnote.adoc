= xtUML Days Presenter Preparation

Dear Shlaer-Mellor xtUML Community,

Wow, less than 3 months until xtUML Days November 4, 5, 6!  We have a long
list of excellent speakers presenting this year.  Stephen Mellor, Colin
Carter, Leon Starr, Ian Wilkie, Marc Balcer, Allan Kennedy and Yuki Tsuchitoi
are some of the big names you may recognize.  Newer names and faces and active
xtUML practitioners are also preparing their materials for the big day.

Linked below is a YouTube video intended to guide our speakers in making
their material suitable for our combined physical-virtual event.  All
presenters are asked to review it carefully.  In the current state of widely
distributed communication, others may find the tips helpful, too.

Reminder!  Early registration ends on the last day of August.  Registration
goes up by $100 on September 1.

Cheers,

xtUML Days 2020 Conference Committee
