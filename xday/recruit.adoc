                                                    presentations from recognized experts
                                                    in the field.  Together with the experience
                                                    reports, these represent the primary
                                                    content of the conference.
| experience report      | exprpt   | 0-4 | 10-30 | Experience reports are medium length
                                                    presentations focused on the application
                                                    of modeling in industry or education.
| panel discusion        | panel    | 0-2 | 10-30 | The panel discussion typically involves a
                                                    moderator and a panel of experts.  Questions
                                                    have been prepared and shared with panel
                                                    members.  Audience participation is included.
| debate                 | debate   | 0-1 | 10-30 | A debate doubles as a networking activity.
                                                    Participants are assigned to groups.  Each
                                                    group is given a position statement to debate.
                                                    After the debate time, summary statements
                                                    are presented by a moderator.

                                                    participants.  Techniques to bridge local
                                                    and remote are to be prepared.

                                                    focusing on the role that makes the person

| tool/app demonstration | demo     | 0-4 |  1-5  | demonstration of a new feature or procedure
                                                    in the tooling (ASL editor, Ciera,

                                                    organizations, these will work best as
                                                    pre-recorded production videos.
| introduction           | intro    | <20 |  1-2  | personal introduction answering

                                                    sharing of a beverage together.  It is
                                                    fun to have a brewmeister or distiller
                                                    present to explain and teach and connect
                                                    those participating online.

== Agenda (DRAFT STRAWMAN)

The columns in the table below are as follows:

* The first column labeled *T* is the minute count for the session.
* The second column labeled *Clock* is the target time of day for the session.
* Column three names to *Presenter*.
* The fourth column labeld *C* indicates the presented has committed.
* The fifth column contains an abbreviation for the *Type* of session as
  defined above.
* Column six gives a hypothetical *Title* to the session if applicable.

Some may need an example line-up to envision the flow of xtUML Days 2020 UK.
The below agenda is an idealized sequence of speakers and presentations
formatted within the above defined session types.  Some sessions are very short.
None of the sessions are long.

Note that this line-up is _draft strawman vision_.  Only a few of the
presenters have committed.  However, it is a feasible vision.
