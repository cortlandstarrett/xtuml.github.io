== Session Types

For virtual, mixed physical/virtual and even physical-only conferences,
variety is a key to engagement.  Various flavors of session are
defined here.

All session types are eligible to be pre-recorded.  For pre-recorded
sessions, the presenter will be available live (locally or remotely)
to respond to questions and comments.

                                                    presentations from recognized experts
                                                    in the field.  Together with the experience
                                                    reports, these represent the primary
                                                    content of the conference.
| experience report      | exprpt   | 0-4 | 10-30 | Experience reports are medium length
                                                    presentations focused on the application
                                                    of modeling in industry or education.
| panel discusion        | panel    | 0-2 | 10-30 | The panel discussion typically involves a
                                                    moderator and a panel of experts.  Questions
                                                    have been prepared and shared with panel
                                                    members.  Audience participation is included.

                                                    Participants are assigned to groups.  Each

                                                    After the debate time, summary statements
                                                    are presented by a moderator.

                                                    participants.  Techniques to bridge local
                                                    and remote are to be prepared.

                                                    sharing of a beverage together.  It is
                                                    fun to have a brewmeister or distiller
                                                    present to explain and teach and connect

== Agenda (Draft)

////

The columns in the table below are as follows:

* The first column labeled *T* is the minute count for the session.
* The second column labeled *Clock* is the target time of day for the session.
* Column three names to *Presenter*.
* The fourth column labeld *C* indicates the presente4 has committed.
* The fifth column contains an abbreviation for the *Type* of session as
  defined in Session Types.
* Column six gives a hypothetical *Title* to the session if applicable.

Some may need an example line-up to envision the flow of xtUML Days 2020 UK.
The below agenda is an idealized sequence of speakers and presentations
formatted within the above defined session types.  Some sessions are very short.
None of the sessions are long.

Note that this line-up is _draft_.
