== What is this?

*Shlaer-Mellor Day 2024* is a modeling conference and represents the 11th
edition of Shlaer-Mellor Day (aka xtUML Day).  (See <<Previous Shlaer-Mellor Days>>.)
Shlaer-Mellor Day is _the_ premier gathering of the year of Shlaer-Mellor modelers.
The Shlaer-Mellor xtUML Community meets to collaborate on Modeling, Method and Tooling.

The central topic of the conference is end-to-end modeling, execution,
translation and deployment of models-as-code in mission critical settings
employing rigorous methodology.  The unifying theme is practical, actual,
industrial application modeling within production installations.
Attendees will network with engineers, scientists and educators who
understand executable and translatable modeling as applied in active
systems.

a| [.big]#The 2024 conference is featuring a modeling challenge.  The subject
matter is the game of chess.  Participants are building robotic xtUML models of
chess strategy ("chess 'bots").  These chess bot models will compete against
each other and human participants.  Results will be presented and explained on
conference day.#

The Shlaer-Mellor Community is keen to exchange expertise and learn from one
another.  Shlaer-Mellor Day provides a forum for developers to share best
practices and influence the direction of the technology.  The conference committee
hereby solicits compelling papers and presentations that exhibit method
advances, tooling improvements and application experience in Shlaer-Mellor
modeling and related Executable/Translatable modeling.

=== Conference Format and Venue

Shlaer-Mellor Day is an information dense and interactive conference
lasting 4 hours.  Presentations with Q&A and discussions will
fill the session.  Shlaer-Mellor Community members will give updates on
