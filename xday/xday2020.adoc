== What is this?

*xtUML Days 2020 UK* is a modeling conference and represents the 7th
edition of xtUML Days.  (See <<Previous xtUML Days>>.)
xtUML Days is the most dense gathering of the year of Shlaer-Mellor modelers.
The xtUML Community meets to collaborate on Modeling, Method and Tooling.

The central topic of the conference is end-to-end modeling, execution,
translation and deployment of models-as-code in mission critical settings
employing rigorous methodology.  The unifying theme is practical, actual,
industrial application modeling within production installations.
Attendees will network with engineers, scientists and educators who
understand executable and translatable modeling as applied in active
systems.

In 2020, a special focus will be continued to extend and
clarify the __Shlaer-Mellor Method__ in light of undocumented developments
over the last several years.


Also in focus:

* Method advances (specifically convergence of PT and K-C dialects)  
* Tooling Refinements  
* Incremental Adoption
* Model Compilation

The xtUML Community is keen to exchange expertise and learn from one
another.  xtUML Days provides a forum for developers to share best
practices and influence the direction of the technology.  xtUML Days
hereby solicits compelling papers and presentations that exhibit method
advances, tooling improvements and application experience in Shlaer-Mellor
modeling and related Executable/Translatable modeling.
This year attendees represent One Fact, UK Crown, BAE Systems, ROGO,
Northrop Grumman, Aurora Consulting, Software Improvements, L3, Thales,
Toyo Corporation, ICS, FrogOOA, Kyushu University, University of Southampton
and Jönköping University.

=== COVID-19 Considerations

__The conference will look much different from previous years.  Your
conference committee efforts will be marked by flexibility and
creativity.  We all hope that the world will be normal enough in
November to meet face-to-face.  Anticipating this, measures are being
taken to apply safe meeting practices.__

__However, all must plan in case travel and gathering are restricted.
A virtual option is being offered in addition to the hope for physical
gathering.  Months of quarantine have taught us a variety of communication
techniques.  These will be employed in ways that allow bridging of the
virtual and physical worlds.  xtUML Days 2020 UK will be the best xtUML
Days yet due to our growth during lockdown.__

__The xtUML Days planning committee is creative and has access to people
who know how to make virtual reality a reality.
A professional event coordinator and audio/visual team have been hired this year.
There are plans for
virtual tours, virtual panel discussions and a virtual happy hour.
See <<Session Types>> below for insight into the variety of presentations.
Such approaches do take some amount of preparation which we are proceeding
to develop!__

=== Keynote Speaker

We are pleased to announce that the xtUML Days 2020 Portsmouth keynote speaker
is http://stephenmellor.com/[**Stephen J. Mellor**], co-author of the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlaer%E2%80%93Mellor_method[__Shlaer–Mellor Method__] and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_UML[__Executable UML__], and signatory to the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#The_Agile_Manifesto[Agile Manifesto].
Mellor has been working with methods, particularly executable methods, for
real-time and embedded systems for four decades.

He explains, with clarity and humor, the intricacies of real-time and
embedded systems model-driven development, in both presentations and
text.  He is the author of several books:

* __Structured Development for Real-Time Systems (Vols 1-3)__
* Object-Oriented Analysis: Modeling the World in https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Systems-Analysis-Modeling/dp/013629023X[Data], and in https://www.amazon.com/Object-Life-Cycles-Modeling-States/dp/0136299407[States].

==== Other Presenters

In addition to Stephen Mellor other key Shlaer-Mellor community members
plan to participate including Colin Carter, Ian Wilkie, Leon Starr, Marc
Balcer and others.

=== Venue

xtUML Days 2020 UK will be physically hosted at https://queenshotelportsmouth.com/[
The Queens Hotel Portsmouth] in Southsea, Portsmouth, UK.  The hotel combines
luxury and history with an ideal location situated with walking access to the
shoreline, parks, restaurants and to Old Portsmouth.

xtUML Days 2020 will be virtually hosted on a platform called
https://hopin.to/[Hopin].  Hopin is better than Zoom alone and better than
YouTube alone.  It emulates physical conference logistics and facilitates
larger scale participation, intimate sessions and 1-on-1 meetings.

=== Registration

Register by emailing the chair (cortland.starrett at onefact.net).  Provide
name and company information.  Do this even if you pay through the electronic
portal below.

The registration cost is identical for both the physical and virtual event.
Our virtual event platform (_Hopin_) will be making the virtual experience
as close to a physical experience as is feasible.  Interestingly, the virtual
experience brings significant additional cost:  camera crew, audio/visual
equipment, streaming, etc.

Early registration (July/August) is $400 (USD).  Early registration assures
the highest likelihood of receiving the SWAG that is being prepared for
all participants both physical and virtual.  Virtual attendees who register
early enough will receive a SWAG box shipped to their home or business address.

After August, registration is $500 (USD).  Participants under contract with the
Community Engagement support option attend at no cost.

Registration payment can be made with a **credit card**
(through a PayPal portal below).  Payment can be made by check.  Other methods
of payment can be arranged through the conference organizers.  Discounts
may be available to companies sending more than 3 participants; contact the chair.

=== Travel and Reception Dinner

Plan to arrive Wednesday evening before the conference to attend a reception
dinner (included in the conference registration while space permits).
Dinner will be hosted at https://www.stillandwest.co.uk/[The Still and West].
A private upstairs space is reserved for xtUML Days guests.  Drinks and
meeting and mixing will precede (and succeed) dinner.  This is a lovely
pub with a view of the Harbour.  (The photo at the top of the page was
taken from inside __The Still and West__.)

=== Hotel

Portsmouth has many hotels and Airbnb options. The xtUML Days organizers
will arrange for a block of hotel rooms with a group rate at the conference
venue (https://queenshotelportsmouth.com/[The Queens Hotel Portsmouth]).
Please check back for details!

== Call for Papers

A program committee will review and select from submitted papers, posters
and presentations.  Selection is based upon perceived value to the xtUML
Community.

Presentations are expected to be 35-45 minutes in duration including
time for questions and discussion.

All submissions will be evaluated by the program committee.  
Selection is based upon significance, clarity and alignment with the call
and value to the attendees of xtUML Days 2020 UK.  Submissions
that promote discussion, advance the Method and generate interaction among
xtUML Community members are most desired.  For a presentation to be
accepted, at least one of the authors must register for xtUML Days,
present the material and participate in the conference.

== Important Dates  

* Title, session type and duration submission:  31 July 2020
* Abstract submission deadline:  15 August 2020
* Author notification:  30 September 2020 (but likely shortly after abstract is submitted)
* Submission deadline for presentation-ready version:  22 October 2020

=== Conference Format
Day 1 of xtUML Days is an information dense and interactive conference
lasting one full day.  The host will welcome attendees at the starting
hour.  The host will make significant introductions.  Key xtUML Community
members will give short updates on their applications and experiences.
Presentations with Q&A and discussions will fill the morning and afternoon
sessions.  An open moderated discussion time will end the day.

A detailed agenda will be available in October upon solidification of the
speaking agenda.

A day 2 of xtUML Days is a planning day for active members of the xtUML
Community.  Planning Day is focused on short and long term requirements of
the Method and road map for tooling.  Day 2 attendance is by invitation only.


== Session Types

For virtual, mixed physical/virtual and even physical-only conferences,
variety is a key to engagement.  Various flavors of session are
defined here.

All session types are eligible to be pre-recorded.  For pre-recorded
