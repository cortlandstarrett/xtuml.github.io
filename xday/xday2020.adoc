== What is this?

*xtUML Days 2020 UK* is a modeling conference and represents the 7th
edition of xtUML Days.  (See <<Previous xtUML Days>>.)
xtUML Days is the most dense gathering of Shlaer-Mellor modelers of the year.
The xtUML Community meets to collaborate on Modeling, Method and Tooling.

The central topic of the conference is end-to-end modeling, execution,
translation and deployment of models-as-code in mission critical settings
employing rigorous methodology.  The unifying theme is practical, actual,
industrial application modeling within production installations.
Attendees will network with engineers, scientists and educators who
understand executable and translatable modeling as applied in active
systems.

In 2020, a special focus will be continued to extend and
clarify the __Shlaer-Mellor Method__ in light of undocumented developments
over the last several years.

Also in focus:

* Method advances (specifically convergence of PT and K-C dialects)  
* Tooling Refinements  

The xtUML Community is keen to exchange expertise and learn from one
another.  xtUML Days provides a forum for developers to share best
practices and influence the direction of the technology.  xtUML Days
hereby solicits compelling papers and presentations that exhibit method
advances, tooling improvements and application experience in Shlaer-Mellor
modeling and related Executable/Translatable modeling.
This year attendees represent One Fact, UK Crown, BAE Systems, ROGO,
Northrop Grumman, Aurora Consulting, Software Improvements, L3, Thales,
Toyo Corporation, ICS, FrogOOA, Kyushu University, University of Southampton
and Jönköping University.
